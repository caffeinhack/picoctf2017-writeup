# Leaf of the Tree  

## Question  
  > We found this annoyingly named directory tree starting at /problems/a47d10dd80018fc6e7e1c5094c1ca323. It would be pretty lame to type out all of those directory names but maybe there is something in there worth finding? And maybe we dont need to type out all those names...? Follow the trunk, using cat and ls!
  
## Solution
  ### 1. Open Terminal  
  Push `Connect` button and open web terminal.

  Move carrent directory with below command.
  ```shell
  cd /problems/a47d10dd80018fc6e7e1c5094c1ca323
  ```
  
  ### 2. Check Other File  
  First, Type `cd ` to terminal.  
  Second, Continue to enter and `t` and hit `tab`,  until you find the file named `flag`.
