# Just No

## Question
  > A program at /problems/276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?   
  
## Solution
### 1. Read source
  When you read the code, you can see that it is a relative path that specifies up to the directory of two executable programs.
ã€€This directory reproduces this structure in a pseudo manner since it has no authority here.
  
### 2. Make Directory
  To reproduce the directory structure, create / problems / 276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60 on the appropriate two directories.
  Like hire.

### 3. Get Flag!
  
Send an appropriate string other than no from auth to the directory you made earlier within 8 letters, and execute justno in that directory.
When you get the Flag!
